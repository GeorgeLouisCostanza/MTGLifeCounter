<p>This App keeps track of all your resources during a Magic: The Gathering (tm) match, namely life and poison counters. You are able to choose between different game modes such as 1vs1, Two-Headed-Giant or Archenemy and the life and poison counters will adjust automatically.</p>

<p>The App also supports different dice so that you do not have to carry your dice bag around with you everytime. Additionally, the App supports archenemy and planechase gamemodes: you can use the App as a Planchase or Scheme deck.</p>

<p>All in all, this App is a companion for every magic player. </p>
